For Aaron's PCA script, I installed MDP from the MDP Toolkit from
<http://downloads.sourceforge.net/mdp-toolkit/MDP-2.2.tar.gz?modtime=1206126105>

I had to install simplejson from PyPI; the version in Etch is inadequate:
$ sudo apt-get install python-setuptools
$ sudo easy_install simplejson==1.8.1

Otherwise, I've used only Debian Etch packages: 

- python-scipy 0.5.2-0.1
- python2.4 2.4.4-3
- python2.4-dev 2.4.4-3

The web.py stuff requires web.py 0.3, which is currently only
available from bzr.

webapp.py also requires some other Python modules; in Debian, I have:

- python-imaging 1.1.5-11
- python-psycopg2 2.0.5.1-6

The sparklines don't look quite as nice with this version of PIL
(python-imaging), perhaps because of `DeprecationWarning: integer
argument expected, got float: self.draw.draw_lines(xy, ink, width)`.
watchdog.notabug.com is running PIL 1.1.6-1.

To run with MySQL (mysqlapp.py), I'm using:

- python-mysqldb 1.2.1-p2-4
