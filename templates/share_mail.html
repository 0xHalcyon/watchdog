$def with (title, url, sender, description=None, is_draft=False, track_id=None)

Dear Friend,

$if track_id:
        $ full_url = "http://watchdog.net" + url + "?tid=" + track_id
$else:
        $ full_url = "http://watchdog.net" + url

$if is_draft:
    Could you please review the draft of the petition "$:title" at $full_url 
    and let me know your comments on it?
$elif description:
       I hope you'll join me in signing the petition "$:title". You can do so right now at:
       
       $full_url
       
       $:description
       
       $full_url
$else:
       I hope you'll find it interesting to visit "$:title" - $full_url.

Thanks!
