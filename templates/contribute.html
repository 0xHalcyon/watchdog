<h1 id="help">Easy ways you can contribute</h1>

<p>Whatever you're interested in, let us know.
We can always need some help from programmers (see our <a href="http://watchdog.jottit.com/volunteer">wiki</a> for a list of projects), designers and researchers,
but you don't need years of experience writing code to help out. 
There are many more ways you can get involved with Watchdog and 
make a difference. Here's a few:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://pledgie.org/campaigns/1764">Make a donation</a></li>
<li><a href="http://watchdog.sifterapp.com">Report a bug</a> you found (user: volunteer, password: watchdog).</li>
<li>Help spread the word - tell your friends about us or mention us on Twitter and Facebook.</li>
<li>Fix one of the bugs listed in our <a href="http://watchdog.sifterapp.com">bug tracker</a> (user: volunteer, password: watchdog)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have ideas you'd like to share with us, feel free to <a href="/about/feedback">contact us</a> or post about it on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/watchdog-volunteers">volunteers mailing list</a>.</p>

<h2 id="code">How can Watchdog.net help me?</h2>

<div class="answer">
<p>
All of our <a href="/code/">source code</a>
and <a href="/data/">source data</a> is open. 
Plus, every important page is also available as an API -- 
look at the bottom to see how you can get it as N3, XML, or JSON
or just query the site with the appropriate <code>Accept:</code> header
to get a machine-readable version.
</p>

<p>
We're also working on a variety of other APIs and tools.
For full details,
<a href="/about/api">read our developer documentation</a>.
